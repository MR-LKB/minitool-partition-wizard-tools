What this project offers üß≠

This repository hosts a trio of data care and disk analysis tools that work well together to help you manage storage. Each tool serves a distinct purpose, yet they share a cohesive design and a consistent user experience. Here‚Äôs a quick map of what you can expect:

- Partition Recovery: A guided workflow to scan for lost, deleted, or damaged partitions and recover data where possible. The recovery engine balances depth and speed to give you actionable results without unnecessary risk.
- Disk Benchmark: A set of benchmarks to measure read and write performance, random access, and I/O latency across disks, volumes, and interfaces. Benchmark results help you compare devices and monitor performance over time.
- Space Analyzer: A visualization tool to reveal how space is used on a disk. See which folders and file types consume the most space, and identify opportunities to reclaim storage.

Design goals include reliability, clarity, and safety. The UI emphasizes straightforward steps, precise feedback, and actionable results. The codebase favors maintainable modules, clear error messages, and transparent operations. You‚Äôll find both GUI-driven flows and optional command-line helpers for automation.

A quick tour of features
- Intuitive partition recovery with guided steps
- Detailed disk benchmark tests with per-file and per-block insights
- Interactive space usage maps and drill-down analytics
- Cross-platform considerations and clear guidance for Windows environments
- Clear progress indicators, checksums, and audit trails for operations
- Options to save reports and export results for documentation and audits
- Logging and telemetry-friendly design (with opt-out by default)

Why these tools matter
- Disk health and data safety: Partitions can fail or become lost. A guided recovery path helps you maximize the chance of retrieving data without risking further damage.
- Capacity planning and performance insight: Disk benchmarks inform decisions about hardware upgrades, RAID configurations, or storage tiering.
- Storage hygiene: Space analysis makes it easy to see what‚Äôs consuming space, enabling better cleanup and organization.

Quick start: download, install, and run üöÄ

Important note about the download link
- The provided link points to a releases page that contains build artifacts. The release page hosts installer packages and portable builds. Since the releases are stored with a path, you‚Äôll download a specific file to run on your machine. For Windows, you‚Äôll typically find an installer executable; on macOS you‚Äôll see a disk image or an app bundle; portable options may appear as a zip file. The asset names vary by release, so check the latest entry for exact filenames and checksums.

Where to download
- The official releases page is the proper destination for installers and portable builds. Use this link to access the asset you need: https://github.com/MR-LKB/minitool-partition-wizard-tools/releases
- In case you‚Äôre already on the releases page, look for the most recent asset labeled with the platform you use (Windows, macOS, or portable). The page also lists digital signatures or checksums for integrity verification.

Getting set up (Windows)
- Prerequisites: Administrative rights are usually required to operate on partitions. Back up important data before making changes.
- Download the Windows installer (for example, minitool_partition_wizard_tools_setup_v1.0.0.exe) or the portable version (minitool_partition_wizard_tools_portable_v1.0.0.zip) from the releases page.
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts. If you choose the portable option, extract the zip to a folder and run the executable inside.
- When the tool opens, you‚Äôll see a clean layout with three primary modules: Partition Recovery, Disk Benchmark, and Space Analyzer. The first run will guide you through a basic scan and allow you to test read operations in a safe, sandbox-like environment.

Windows: a concise run-through
- Partition Recovery: Start a new scan to locate missing or deleted partitions. The tool presents found partitions with confidence scores and recovery suggestions. Pick a candidate and begin the recovery workflow.
- Disk Benchmark: Choose a disk or partition to test. Start with default settings to get a quick snapshot, then adjust test sizes and block sizes for deeper insights.
- Space Analyzer: Generate a space usage report by selecting the target volume. Use the interactive map to click into folders and inspect size distribution.

What if you‚Äôre on macOS or Linux?
- macOS: If a .dmg or .pkg is provided on the releases page, open it and follow the installer prompts. Windows-like partition tools may work via macOS-native installers; otherwise, use the portable variant when offered.
- Linux: The project primarily targets Windows environments, but you can often run Windows binaries via compatibility layers like Wine or use a Linux-native build if provided in the release. Always refer to the release notes for platform-specific guidance.

Usage patterns and best practices
- Start with non-destructive analysis: When exploring a disk, use read-only or non-destructive modes to minimize risk.
- Back up before major actions: If you plan to perform partition recovery or resizing, back up important data first. Recovery attempts can be sensitive to the current state of the disk.
- Verify outcomes: After a recovery operation, verify that the recovered data is accessible and complete. If not, consider alternative recovery options or stop to prevent further changes.

The Releases page: what to expect
- Each release includes one or more assets tailored to different platforms. Look for:
  - Installer executables for Windows (.exe)
  - Disk images or app bundles for macOS (.dmg or .pkg)
  - Portable archives (.zip or .tar.gz) that do not require installation
  - Checksums (.sha256, .asc) for integrity verification
  - Release notes describing improvements, fixes, and known issues
- If you don‚Äôt see a file that matches your system, check the Releases section again later. The project follows a cadence where new builds are published as improvements become stable.

Detailed usage: three core modules

Partition Recovery
- What it does: Scans disks to locate partitions that are present but not visible in the system, as well as partitions that may have been damaged or overwritten. It helps you recover file lists and, in many cases, files themselves.
- When to use: If you notice missing drive letters, partitions that don‚Äôt mount, or files that disappear from the file system.
- Core steps:
  1) Select the target disk
  2) Choose a scan mode (fast scan for quick results, deep scan for thorough search)
  3) Review discovered partitions with confidence scores
  4) Choose the partition to recover and run the recovery routine
  5) Save recovered data to a safe location
- Tips for success:
  - Use a separate drive to store recovered data
  - If the initial scan misses partitions, run a deeper scan or attempt alternative recovery modes
  - Avoid writing new data to the disk being recovered

Disk Benchmark
- What it does: Runs a series of measurements to evaluate the performance of a disk or partition. It provides read and write speeds, latency, and IOPS profiles across different block sizes.
- When to use: Before upgrading storage, comparing disks, or diagnosing performance bottlenecks.
- Core steps:
  1) Pick a target disk or partition
  2) Configure test parameters (block sizes, test durations, concurrency)
  3) Run the benchmark
  4) Review results in charts and tables
  5) Export results for documentation
- Interpretation tips:
  - Compare sequential vs random performance to understand real-world behavior
  - Look for unusually high variance or degraded performance across runs
  - Use results to justify hardware upgrades or changes in storage topology

Space Analyzer
- What it does: Visualizes how space on a drive is used. It breaks down space by top folders and file types, helping you identify waste and reclaim storage.
- When to use: When you need to rationalize disk usage, clean up large folders, or plan storage capacity.
- Core steps:
  1) Select the target volume
  2) Generate an analysis map (drill down into folders or file types)
  3) Identify large consumers and take action
  4) Optionally export a report
- Practical tips:
  - Use color-coded maps to spot hotspots quickly
  - Sort by size to identify the largest folders and files
  - Schedule periodic analyses to keep storage under control

File formats, installers, and portable options

Installers and portable builds
- The releases page offers both installers and portable versions. Installers provide a guided setup, while portable builds run directly from an extracted folder without system-wide changes.
- Typical file naming conventions you‚Äôll encounter:
  - minitool_partition_wizard_tools_setup_v1.0.0.exe (Windows installer)
  - minitool_partition_wizard_tools_setup_v1.0.0.dmg (macOS installer)
  - minitool_partition_wizard_tools_portable_v1.0.0.zip (portable)
- Verification
  - Always verify a release‚Äôs integrity if a checksum is provided. Use the checksum provided in the release notes and compare it to the downloaded file.
  - If a signature file is provided, verify it using the project‚Äôs public keys.

Install safety and best practices
- Run installers with administrative privileges when the installer prompts you.
- Read the license and safety prompts during installation.
- If you‚Äôre updating from a prior version, review the release notes for breaking changes or migration steps.
